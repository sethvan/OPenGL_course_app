# First argument should always be at least `include` and if path contains subdirectories then the additional directory 
# hierarchy should already have been added to both the `include` and `src` directories before calling this script.

# IOW `./createclass include Player` will create `player.h` in `include` directory and `player.cpp` in `src` directory.

# with the name `Shaders` should already exist in both `include` and `src` before you call this script and the call
# for that would be `./createclass include/shaders Vertex`
